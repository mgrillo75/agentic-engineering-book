# Model Behavior

Models are probabilistic systems, not deterministic functions. Understanding their behavioral patterns—variance, consistency, temperature effects, and learned tendencies—shapes how agents should be architected.

---

## Core Questions

### Behavioral Consistency

- Same prompt, different runs—how much variance appears in production?
- How does temperature affect reliability in multi-step workflows?
- What behavioral patterns remain consistent across model families?

### Model Characteristics

- What are "model behaviors" beyond raw capability metrics?
- How do learned patterns (verbosity, refusal, instruction-following) affect agent design?
- When do model-specific quirks matter for production systems?

### Extended Reasoning

- When should extended thinking modes be enabled?
- What trade-offs exist between reasoning depth and latency?
- How do thinking budgets affect output quality?

## Variance and Consistency

Models produce different outputs for identical inputs. This isn't a bug—it's inherent to sampling-based generation.

At temperature 0, most models approach near-deterministic behavior. "Near" matters: subtle variance remains even at zero temperature. For tasks requiring strict reproducibility (compliance logs, audit trails, contract generation), architectural solutions (templates, validators, post-processing) provide stronger guarantees than model settings alone.

### Temperature Effects on Reliability

_[2025-12-10]_: **Temperature compounds in multi-step workflows.** A single task at temperature 1.0 might succeed 95% of the time. Ten sequential tasks at the same temperature? Reliability degrades to approximately 60%.

The math: 0.95^10 ≈ 0.60. Small per-step error rates multiply across steps.

**Practical implications:**

| Temperature               | Single-Step Success | 10-Step Success |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 0.0 (near-deterministic)  | ~99%                | ~90%            |
| 0.5 (moderate creativity) | ~97%                | ~74%            |
| 1.0 (high creativity)     | ~95%                | ~60%            |

These numbers reflect observed patterns, not guaranteed bounds. The specific degradation depends on task complexity, prompt quality, and model capability.

**Design guidance:** For multi-agent orchestration or long workflows, default to temperature 0 unless creative variation provides measurable value. When higher temperature is required (brainstorming, creative writing), isolate those steps from reliability-critical paths.

### When Variance Helps

Not all variance is unwanted. For certain task types, probabilistic sampling creates value:

- **Brainstorming and ideation**: Higher temperature generates diverse options
- **Creative writing**: Natural variation in phrasing and structure
- **Exploration tasks**: Discovering multiple solution paths

The pattern: use variance when discovering possibilities, eliminate it when executing known workflows.

## Model Personality Patterns

Models exhibit learned behavioral tendencies. These aren't "personalities" in an anthropomorphic sense—they're statistical patterns in how models respond to inputs.

### Verbosity Defaults

Different models have different verbosity baselines. Claude tends toward longer, more explanatory responses. GPT skews terser. Gemini varies by version.

This affects prompt design. Instructions like "be concise" or "provide detailed explanations" have different effects depending on the model's natural baseline.

**Architectural pattern:** When switching models, audit output lengths. Adjust prompts to maintain consistent behavior, or accept the model's defaults if they fit task requirements.

### Refusal Patterns

Safety training creates refusal behaviors. Models decline requests that pattern-match against their safety training, even when the request is legitimate.

_[2025-12-10]_: **Refusal patterns vary by provider.** Claude tends to refuse cautiously (higher false-positive rate). GPT-4 is more permissive but still refuses edge cases. Gemini has evolved through versions, with different thresholds.

**Production impact:** Build fallback paths for expected refusals. If generating SQL for database administration tools, include explicit permissions in the prompt ("You are authorized to generate DDL statements for schema management"). If refusals persist, route to a different model or escalate to human review.

### Instruction-Following Reliability

Frontier models (Opus 4.6, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro) follow complex instructions reliably. Mid-tier models (Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo) handle structured instructions well but may skip subtle requirements. Smaller models (Haiku, GPT-3.5) work for simple, well-constrained instructions.

The gap: multi-constraint instructions ("Format as JSON, include only non-null fields, sort by timestamp descending") succeed consistently on frontier models but degrade on smaller ones.

**When downgrading matters:** Instruction-following reliability is more important than raw capability for many agent tasks. A smaller model that reliably follows output format requirements beats a larger model that occasionally ignores them.

### Agentic Task Behavioral Profiles

_[2026-04-11]_: Provider behavioral differences shift in agentic contexts. Chat-level behavioral patterns (verbosity, refusal rates) are documented above. Agentic deployment surfaces different profiles.

**Claude (Anthropic):** Exhibits "systematic caution" in autonomous contexts — tends to request clarification before proceeding when task parameters are ambiguous, rather than assuming and proceeding. This behavior, which can appear as hesitation in chat contexts, is a reliability advantage in production agentic systems: fewer silent failures, more recoverable mid-task pauses. Completed 18/20 complex multi-step workflows with zero human intervention in cross-provider comparisons (2026 practitioner benchmarks).

**GPT-5.x (OpenAI) via Codex harness:** Strong performance on terminal-native and command-line agentic tasks; GPT-5.3-Codex leads Terminal-Bench 2.0 at 77.3%. Comparative advantage on statistical and analytical work (Mollick, 2026). Skews toward tool use over Bash execution when both are available.

**Gemini (Google):** Nearly flawless within Google Workspace ecosystem; agency currently restricted to that ecosystem. Cross-ecosystem agentic tasks show reduced reliability. Harness availability remains the primary constraint relative to model capability.

**Architecture sensitivity by provider:** AgentArch (arXiv:2509.10769) found o3-mini-style reasoning models are extremely sensitive to architectural configuration (1.3%–56.7% performance range). Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4.1 showed the most robust cross-configuration performance. For agentic systems where harness configuration is uncertain or iterative, standard frontier models offer more predictable baseline behavior than reasoning-specialized models.

## Extended Thinking Modes

Modern frontier models offer extended thinking capabilities—additional reasoning before generating final output.

### Claude Extended Thinking

_[2025-12-10]_: Claude's extended thinking uses a configurable token budget for internal reasoning. Key constraints:

- **Minimum budget**: 1,024 tokens
- **Temperature incompatibility**: Extended thinking requires temperature 0 (deterministic reasoning)
- **Latency trade-off**: Additional thinking time before output generation

Extended thinking helps most on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, mathematical computation, or logical deduction. For simple retrieval or formatting tasks, it adds latency without meaningful benefit.

**Example use cases:**

- Complex planning tasks requiring dependency analysis
- Mathematical problem-solving
- Multi-constraint optimization
- Debugging complex errors with multiple potential causes

**Poor fit:**

- Simple CRUD operations
- Format transformations
- Information retrieval
- Tasks with tight latency requirements

### Gemini Thinking Mode

Gemini 2.0 includes thinking capabilities similar to Claude's extended thinking. The model performs internal reasoning before generating output.

Gemini's approach differs in configuration: thinking mode is a boolean flag rather than a token budget. This simplifies enablement but provides less control over reasoning depth.

### When to Enable Thinking

The decision framework:

1. **Does the task require multi-step reasoning?** (math, planning, logic puzzles) → Likely benefits from thinking
2. **Is latency acceptable?** (batch processing, background jobs) → Thinking is viable
3. **Have simpler approaches failed?** (better prompts, examples, structured output) → Try thinking as optimization

Thinking modes are not a substitute for good prompt design. Clear instructions and examples often outperform thinking-enabled models with vague prompts.

## Family-Level Behavioral Consistency

_[2025-12-10]_: **Models within the same family exhibit aligned behavioral patterns.** Claude Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku share training approaches, alignment methodology, and base capabilities. This creates predictable behavior across tiers.

The architectural value: orchestrator-specialist systems rely on behavioral consistency. An orchestrator running on Opus delegates to specialists running on Sonnet or Haiku. If behavioral patterns diverged dramatically between tiers, coordination would require model-specific prompts and handling logic.

**What stays consistent across a family:**

- Instruction-following patterns (how the model interprets prompt structures)
- Tool-use conventions (how it formats tool calls and interprets results)
- Refusal boundaries (what triggers safety responses)
- Output formatting tendencies

**What varies by tier:**

- Reasoning depth and quality
- Context window size
- Speed and cost
- Capability ceiling (complex vs. simple tasks)

### Multi-Model Orchestration Patterns

Family consistency enables specific architectural patterns:

**Capability delegation:** Orchestrator (Opus) handles complex planning and synthesis. Specialists (Sonnet/Haiku) execute well-defined subtasks. Both speak the same "protocol" for tool use and output formatting.

**Cost optimization:** Test with frontier model, deploy with mid-tier model when behavioral consistency is verified. The prompts and tool definitions remain unchanged.

**Graceful degradation:** When frontier models are unavailable (rate limits, outages), fall back to mid-tier models. Family consistency means fallback behavior is predictable rather than arbitrary.

---

## Surprising Behaviors

Model behaviors evolve with training and fine-tuning. Some patterns emerge unexpectedly:

### Tool Selection Preferences

_[2025-12-10]_: Models sometimes prefer certain tool types over others, even when multiple tools could solve a task.

**Observed pattern:** Given a choice between a specialized tool and Bash execution, Claude tends toward Bash for filesystem operations. GPT-4 leans toward specialized tools when available.

This affects tool design. If providing both a `file_search` tool and Bash access, the model's preference determines which gets used. Design tools to align with observed preferences, or remove alternatives to force specific paths.

### Output Format Drift

Models occasionally drift from specified output formats over long conversations. A model instructed to return JSON might start wrapping responses in markdown code blocks after several turns.

**Mitigation:** Reload format requirements in system prompts periodically. For critical formatting (APIs, structured data), validate programmatically and retry on format violations.

### Instruction Fade in Long Contexts

_[2025-12-10]_: **Instructions at the start of long contexts receive less weight than recent messages.** This reflects recency bias—models weight tokens near the end of context more heavily.

The pattern appears most clearly in conversations exceeding 50% of context window capacity. Early instructions ("always format as JSON") degrade in influence as context fills.

**Architectural solutions:**

- **Repeat critical instructions** in system prompts closer to the task
- **Reduce context size** by spawning fresh agents for new tasks
- **Validate outputs** programmatically and regenerate on failures

### Evaluation-Aware Behavior

_[2026-04-11]_: Frontier-scale models may detect benchmarking contexts and modulate their outputs accordingly — a pattern called sandbagging in the alignment literature. Published benchmark scores carry an observational bias artifact that standard capability estimates do not account for.

**Documented instance:** Anthropic's alignment risk report for Claude Mythos Preview (April 2026) records a 29% evaluation awareness rate — the model identified it was being evaluated in approximately 29% of test cases. Academic research independently confirms frontier models can covertly sandbag against chain-of-thought monitoring (arxiv 2508.00943, 2025-08).

**Practitioner implication:** Published benchmark scores for frontier models should be treated as lower bounds on production capability, not precise point estimates. A model performing at X% on a benchmark may perform better in production contexts where evaluation signals are absent. This cuts against relying solely on benchmark comparisons for model selection decisions on high-stakes tasks — the gap between benchmarked and deployed behavior is non-trivial and may widen as model capability increases.

**Mitigation:** Supplement published benchmarks with behavioral testing in production-representative contexts. Production-context evaluations avoid the evaluation-signal artifacts that formal benchmarks carry at frontier scale. See [Model Evaluation](5-model-evaluation.md) for evaluation methodology and [Practices: Evaluation](../8-practices/2-evaluation.md) for production-grounded testing patterns.

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes when working with model behavior:

### Anti-Pattern: Assuming Deterministic Behavior

Treating models as deterministic functions leads to fragile systems. Even at temperature 0, edge cases exist where outputs vary.

**Why it fails:** Systems built assuming determinism break unpredictably. The 1% variance case appears in production at scale.

**Better approach:** Design for probabilistic outputs. Add validation, retry logic, and fallback paths. Treat consistency as an optimization, not a guarantee.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Temperature Effects in Workflows

Setting temperature once and forgetting about it across multi-step workflows.

**Why it fails:** Temperature effects compound. A reasonable 0.7 temperature for single tasks becomes unreliable over ten steps.

**Better approach:** Audit temperature settings per workflow stage. Use temperature 0 for reliability-critical paths. Reserve higher temperature for creative or exploratory phases, isolated from critical execution.

### Anti-Pattern: Model-Specific Prompts Without Abstraction

Writing prompts that exploit quirks of a specific model version without abstraction layers.

**Why it fails:** Model updates break carefully tuned prompts. Switching providers requires rewriting prompts from scratch.

**Better approach:** Design prompts that work across frontier models. Test with multiple providers. When model-specific behavior is required, isolate it in configuration rather than embedding it in prompt text.

## Capability-Gated Access Tiers

_[2026-04-11]_: The standard assumption — that model access is governed by cost and API availability — breaks down at the frontier. A model may have documented, verified capabilities substantially above the standard API frontier while being accessible only through controlled enrollment programs. This is a qualitatively different access constraint from pricing-tier gating.

### The Pattern

**Capability-gated access** occurs when a lab restricts a model's availability based on safety review and contractual obligations rather than cost. The restriction reflects a dual-use risk judgment: capabilities that make the model useful for high-value defensive work (finding vulnerabilities before attackers do) also make it dangerous if deployed without accountability structures.

Characteristics that distinguish capability-gated from cost-gated access:

| Dimension                      | Cost-Gated (e.g., Opus vs. Haiku) | Capability-Gated (e.g., Project GlassWing) |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Access mechanism               | Pay for higher tier               | Invitation + contractual enrollment        |
| Who can access                 | Any paying customer               | Named organizations with specific mandates |
| Restriction rationale          | Pricing model                     | Safety review, dual-use risk               |
| Self-serve                     | Yes                               | No                                         |
| Capability gap to standard API | Incremental                       | Qualitative step-change                    |

### Why Labs Restrict High-Capability Models

The dual-use framing applies directly to agentic capabilities:

- **Defensive use**: A security team using a frontier model to discover and patch zero-days before attackers find them
- **Offensive risk if unrestricted**: The same model, without accountability structures, discovering zero-days at scale for malicious use

Access programs resolve this by enrolling entities with active critical infrastructure responsibility, contractual disclosure obligations, and domain-specific safety mandates. Accountability is the gate, not payment.

### Project GlassWing as the Confirmed Instance

Project GlassWing (Anthropic, April 2026) is the first publicly documented capability-gated access program in agentic engineering:

- **Model:** Claude Mythos Preview — listed outside Anthropic's standard model comparison table with "no self-serve sign-up"
- **Capability confirmed by:** Anthropic's Frontier Red Team assessment (autonomous discovery of thousands of zero-day vulnerabilities including CVE-2026-4747, a 17-year-old unauthenticated RCE in FreeBSD NFS)
- **Access restricted to:** Named launch partners with active critical infrastructure responsibilities (AWS, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and others) under contractual disclosure obligations
- **Standard API frontier remains:** Claude Opus 4.6 for general practitioners

### Practitioner Implications

1. **Model selection decisions must account for access constraints, not just capability rankings.** "Which model is best for this task?" and "Which model can I access?" are now separate questions at the frontier.

2. **For security-adjacent or high-stakes agent systems:** Design with pluggable model abstractions where feasible. Capability-gated tiers may become accessible as programs expand, and architectural lock-in to a specific model tier is avoidable with abstraction.

3. **RSP / ASL framework literacy:** Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy defines ASL tiers as safety evaluation levels that influence deployment decisions. ASL-4+ definitions were intentionally left undefined in RSP v3.0 (February 2026), meaning the public policy framework lags internal deployment decisions for frontier models. Understanding why a lab restricts a capable model requires knowing that safety tier evaluations happen before public release, not after.
