# Enterprise Codebase Context Tools

As of early 2026, the tooling landscape for enterprise brownfield context management is consolidating but not stable. The patterns documented in [Context at Codebase Scale](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md) are durable; the specific products that implement those patterns are not. This survey reflects the tool state as of early 2026 and should be treated as a starting point for evaluation rather than a permanent reference.

This survey covers nine tools organized by which of Part A's seven patterns they implement. Tools that address enterprise constraints without a direct pattern mapping (Tabnine Enterprise for air-gap enforcement) appear in the constraint matrix and under the Graduated Adoption section. Tools excluded from this survey — Codebase-Memory (early-stage research; insufficient production evidence as of early 2026), Cursor (separate IDE environment; does not compose with Claude Code) — are noted for completeness.

## Pattern-to-Tool Map

_Note: Tool state as of early 2026. The patterns in [Context at Codebase Scale](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md) are the durable reference; products listed here are current implementations._

### [Semantic Indexing](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-1-semantic-indexing) tools

The Semantic Indexing pattern is the most tooled category — five distinct options span the spectrum from zero-infrastructure OSS to managed enterprise cloud. The primary selection axes are: data residency (does code leave the machine?), scale (how many files?), and control (managed vs. self-hosted). Tools in this category generate the token-budgeted symbol maps that serve as Tier 1 input for the Progressive Codebase Disclosure composition pattern.

| Tool                                        | What it implements                                                                                             | Claude Code composition path                                                                                      | Key constraint/requirement                                                                                     | Enterprise story                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aider Repo Map** (tree-sitter + PageRank) | Symbol extraction + reference-frequency ranking fitted to a token budget                                       | Feed repo map output into Claude Code context; or use RepoMapper MCP server (pdavis68) for direct MCP integration | Requires tree-sitter language parsers; structure-oriented (not semantic similarity)                            | OSS, self-hosted, no data leaves machine; supports 130+ languages                                                               |
| **Augment Code** (Context Engine MCP)       | Managed semantic index up to 500K files; dependency graph across functions, classes, modules                   | Context Engine MCP — Claude Code calls into Augment's semantic graph as a tool                                    | Code leaves the developer machine for indexing; verify data handling agreements for sensitive codebases        | SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 42001 AI governance certification; on-prem deployment available                                          |
| **Sourcegraph Amp** (+ MCP server)          | Semantic search + code graph across multi-repo org scale (250K+ repos, 10M+ lines)                             | Sourcegraph MCP server via OAuth; Claude Code (or Amp CLI) calls code search and graph context as tools           | Enterprise contract required; requires existing Sourcegraph deployment for full value                          | SSO/SCIM/SAML/OIDC, audit logs, on-prem model hosting; best for orgs with existing Sourcegraph investment                       |
| **Continue.dev**                            | tree-sitter + ripgrep + embeddings; `@Codebase` semantic search; custom RAG MCP server for team sharing        | Indirect — Continue handles IDE workflow; Claude Code handles headless tasks; teams run both in parallel          | Configuration investment required; team must share pre-built index via custom RAG MCP server                   | Apache-2.0, fully self-hostable, supports local embedding models for air-gapped deployment                                      |
| **Qdrant + tree-sitter** (DIY)              | Custom semantic indexing pipeline: parse → embed (local model) → store → expose via MCP `codebase_search` tool | Via MCP — expose `codebase_search(query, path?)` as a tool; Claude Code calls it like any other tool              | Platform/DevEx archetype only; highest setup cost; requires existing vector infrastructure or greenfield build | Qdrant Hybrid Cloud: on-prem processing with centralized management; RBAC with OAuth2/OIDC; full control over what gets indexed |

### [Hierarchical Convention Files](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-2-hierarchical-convention-files) tools

No separate tooling required. Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files from root through subdirectory hierarchy natively — home directory → git root → parent directories → current directory → subdirectories as needed. The pattern is implemented by file placement: a `services/payments/CLAUDE.md` is discovered and loaded automatically when Claude Code operates in that directory subtree. Module-level convention files inherit root context and add module-specific overrides; the inheritance model is implicit in Claude Code's loading order.

Combine with any indexing tool above for full coverage — convention files capture the _why_ (constraints, ownership, implicit workflows); indexing tools capture the _what_ (symbol structure, call relationships). Neither replaces the other. The research brief notes a best practice of 100–200 lines per convention file, with additional specifics pushed into subdirectory files to avoid root context bloat.

### [Decision Records as Agent Context](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-3-decision-records-as-agent-context) tools

No specialized tooling is required. ADRs are plain-text markdown files that compose with any agent workflow — they require no indexing infrastructure, no MCP server, no parsing pipeline. Implementation path: add the ADR directory path to the root convention file so Claude Code-driven agents discover relevant records for the modules they navigate. Agents reading an ADR before modifying constrained code encounter the decision rationale before making changes, not after.

The Agent Decision Record (AgDR) format (GitHub: me2resh/agent-decision-record) extends the standard ADR structure with fields specific to AI-assisted development decisions — tracking which agent or model assisted with a decision, what context was available, and what alternatives the AI surfaced. As of early 2026 this is an emerging extension, not an established standard.

For retrospective ADR generation in legacy codebases that predate ADR practices, agents can draft candidate ADRs from commit history, test names, and inline comments. The drafts require engineer review and correction. The AI-assisted retrospective ADR pattern is documented in practitioner literature (Chris Swan, July 2025) and represents a viable path for surfacing implicit decisions in codebases where no ADR practice existed.

### [Dependency-Graph Queries](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-4-dependency-graph-queries) tools

Tools in this category answer the change impact question: what breaks if this interface changes? The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is the technical standard underlying most options — it enables type-aware navigation that text search cannot replicate, particularly for statically typed languages. The critical limitation documented in Part A applies here: cross-language dependency resolution (Go calling Python calling Go gRPC) remains unsolved by all current LSP-backed tools.

| Tool                                  | What it implements                                                                                                    | Claude Code composition path                                                                                    | Key constraint/requirement                                                                                 | Enterprise story                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Serena MCP**                        | LSP-backed symbol navigation: go-to-definition, find-references, rename, type inference — without reading whole files | Native MCP — add Serena as an MCP server in Claude Code config; overlapping file/search ops disabled by default | Requires language servers installed locally; strongest for statically typed languages (Java, C#, Go, Rust) | OSS (GitHub: oraios/serena), fully local, no cloud dependency; 40+ languages via LSP; released January 2026 |
| **Augment Code** (Context Engine MCP) | Dependency graph across functions, classes, modules, imports, data flows — at managed scale                           | Context Engine MCP as above                                                                                     | Same data-handling caveat as Semantic Indexing row                                                         | Same enterprise certifications as Semantic Indexing row                                                     |

### [Progressive Codebase Disclosure](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-5-progressive-codebase-disclosure) tools

Progressive Codebase Disclosure is a composition pattern — it is implemented by combining Semantic Indexing tools (Tier 1: metadata index) with on-demand file retrieval (Tier 2 and 3). No single tool delivers all three tiers.

| Tool                         | Role in composition     | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RepoMapper MCP**           | Tier 1 (metadata index) | Lightweight MCP wrapper around Aider's repo map logic; generates on-demand structure maps that Claude Code receives as Tier 1 context |
| **Aider Repo Map**           | Tier 1 (metadata index) | Direct CLI output fed into context; RepoMapper MCP is the Claude Code composition path                                                |
| Any indexing tool (above)    | Tier 1 input            | Semantic index feeds the disclosure pattern; tool choice follows Semantic Indexing decision criteria                                  |
| Claude Code native Read tool | Tier 2 and 3            | File-level and dependency reads triggered by agent as task narrows                                                                    |

### [Tribal Knowledge Codification](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-6-tribal-knowledge-codification) tools

No separate tooling required for convention files and expertise.yaml — these are native to the Claude Code configuration system. For retrospective documentation generation at legacy-codebase scale:

| Tool                           | What it implements                                                                                                                                          | Claude Code composition path                                                                                                                                   | Key constraint/requirement                                                                                              | Enterprise story                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognition Devin / DeepWiki** | Retrospective documentation generation: always-updating wiki with system diagrams for entire repos, including legacy codebases (COBOL, old Java, 5M+ lines) | No direct MCP composition. Use Devin for documentation generation; feed DeepWiki output into CLAUDE.md context and expertise files for Claude Code consumption | SaaS product, not an IDE plugin; code leaves the organization for processing — not suitable for air-gapped environments | Documented at production scale: 5M-line COBOL, 500GB repos; Nubank monolith refactoring case study (January 2026) |

### [Graduated Adoption](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#pattern-7-graduated-adoption) tools

The Graduated Adoption pattern (Encoding → Documenting → Consolidating → Specializing → Enforcing) does not require external tooling for its first three stages — slash commands, convention files, and prompt consolidation are implemented in markdown files native to Claude Code. The Specializing and Enforcing stages benefit from the full toolkit described in this survey: expert agent domains, hooks, and the indexing tools above.

**Tabnine Enterprise** fits at the Enforcing stage for compliance-bound enterprises. Its enterprise context engine (GA February 2026) learns org-specific architecture, frameworks, and coding standards — operating in air-gapped Kubernetes or fully isolated GPU deployments. No native MCP composition is documented; Tabnine operates as a self-contained IDE assistant (VS Code, JetBrains) rather than exposing a context API for external agents. For teams whose Enforcing stage requires air-gapped tooling as a hard constraint, Tabnine Enterprise is the only commercial option with explicit GPU-accelerated air-gap support as of early 2026.

---

## Selection Guidance

The constraint matrix determines which tools are eligible; the following heuristics determine which to evaluate first.

**If the codebase exceeds 100K files and the team wants a managed solution:**
Augment Code's Context Engine MCP is the highest-leverage single tool — semantic index plus dependency graph, composing with Claude Code via MCP, with enterprise certifications for regulated environments. First-run indexing takes 15–30 minutes on large repos; incremental updates thereafter.

**If the organization already uses Sourcegraph for code search:**
Add the Sourcegraph MCP server. The bridge gives Claude Code (or Amp CLI) access to the full code graph with enterprise access controls already in place. Marginal adoption cost is low when Sourcegraph infrastructure is already deployed.

**If air-gapped or regulated (defense, healthcare, finance):**
Tabnine Enterprise for commercial support with GPU-accelerated air-gap; Continue.dev plus local embedding models for open-source flexibility. Serena MCP and Aider Repo Map are always additive — both are fully local and compose with Claude Code without network calls.

**If the primary problem is navigating unfamiliar statically typed code:**
Serena MCP runs locally, requires no cloud dependency, and provides precise symbol-level navigation that text search cannot replicate for Java, C#, Go, or Rust codebases. The setup cost is installing language servers; the operational cost is zero.

**If the primary problem is understanding why legacy code exists:**
Cognition Devin / DeepWiki generates retrospective documentation at scale (5M-line COBOL, 500GB repos have been documented). The output feeds into CLAUDE.md convention files and expertise files that Claude Code consumes in subsequent sessions. Devin is not a Claude Code integration — it is a prerequisite for effective Claude Code use in the most opaque legacy systems.

**For all enterprise brownfield, regardless of which indexing tool is chosen:**
Nested CLAUDE.md files are always additive. Convention files capture what semantic search cannot infer — the constraints, ownership regimes, and implicit workflows that exist only in engineer memory. Start with module-level CLAUDE.md files for the highest-risk modules before investing in indexing infrastructure.

## Honest Gaps (as of early 2026)

**PII filtering at index time.** Semantic indices built over production codebases may index secrets, PII, or proprietary business logic. No current tool filters PII at index construction time — the content reaches the index before any filtering occurs. The workaround (AI gateway at prompt time) filters what reaches the LLM but does not prevent sensitive content from being indexed. This is an architectural gap: the gateway layer is positioned after indexing in the data flow, not before it. The consequence is that sensitive content can be indexed and stored even when it is correctly blocked before reaching the LLM. Mitigations require either a pre-indexing scrubbing pipeline (custom build, no off-the-shelf tooling as of early 2026), strict repository scope limitation, or exclusive use of air-gapped tools where code never leaves the VPC.

**Cross-language dependency resolution.** A Go service calling a Python API calling a Go gRPC endpoint: no single tool traces cross-language call paths with full semantic accuracy. LSP analysis is language-scoped — a Java LSP cannot follow a method call that exits to a Python service via HTTP. Tree-sitter parsing is similarly language-scoped. The cross-language blast radius of a change remains a manual documentation problem: which convention files reference the cross-language interface, which ADRs document the protocol contract. Automated tooling for cross-language dependency tracing does not exist as of early 2026. This limits the Dependency-Graph Queries pattern's effectiveness in polyglot systems and represents the most significant capability gap for enterprise brownfield deployments.

**Cost at scale for high-frequency agent loops.** Managed indexing APIs (Augment Context Engine MCP, Sourcegraph RAG) add latency and token cost per agent turn. For high-frequency agent loops — multiple calls per minute across a large development team — the aggregate cost is material but poorly documented. Practitioners report that caching frequent queries and narrowing query scope are necessary at scale, but tooling support for query-level caching and cost attribution is immature. The economic threshold at which managed cloud indexing becomes more expensive than Platform/DevEx-maintained local infrastructure varies significantly by query volume, codebase size, and team size; no published benchmarks exist as of early 2026.

These three gaps overlap directly with the open questions raised in [Context at Codebase Scale](../4-context/6-context-at-codebase-scale.md#open-questions): cross-language dependency tracing, PII filtering at index time, and cost at scale are identified there as unsolved problems in the pattern layer. The tool layer has the same unsolved problems — they are not tool-specific failures but architectural gaps that tooling alone cannot close.

The same auto-selection thresholds and deployment architecture decisions apply to Serena, Augment's Context Engine MCP, and Sourcegraph's MCP server.

- **To [Tool Design](../5-tool-use/1-tool-design.md):** The context contract pattern applies to evaluating the tools in this survey — each tool's interface (what it accepts, what it returns, what it costs in tokens) is the criteria for composability with Claude Code workflows.

- **To [Claude Code](1-claude-code.md):** MCP configuration is the integration path for Serena, Augment's Context Engine MCP, Sourcegraph's MCP server, and RepoMapper MCP. The MCP server configuration in `.claude/settings.json` is how these tools become available in Claude Code sessions.
