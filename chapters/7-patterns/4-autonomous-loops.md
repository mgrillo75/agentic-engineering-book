# Autonomous Loops (Ralph Wiggum)

An autonomous iteration loop pattern that runs indefinite retry cycles with fresh context windows per iteration, treating git history as external memory and failures as learning data rather than blockers.

---

## Core Implementation

The canonical implementation reduces to a single line:

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done
```

Each iteration:

1. Loads task specification from PROMPT.md
2. Spawns fresh Claude Code session
3. Executes task attempt
4. Commits changes (if any)
5. Exits session, discards context
6. Repeats indefinitely

The loop continues until manual termination or built-in stop conditions trigger.

---

## Your Mental Model

**The loop is the hero, not the model.** When 40-60% of context window exhibits high-quality reasoning (the "smart zone"), naive persistence through repeated attempts compounds into eventual success. Twenty mediocre iterations outperform one perfect plan.

**Git history is memory.** State persists in commits, not context windows. Each iteration reads `git log` to understand prior attempts—what succeeded, what failed, what patterns emerged. Fresh context prevents cascading errors from poisoned conversation history.

**Failures are data.** Failed iterations create commits with error messages that guide subsequent attempts. The pattern embraces failure as exploration rather than blocking progress.

---

## Architecture Components

### PROMPT.md Structure

Effective autonomous loop prompts specify outcomes, not procedures:

```markdown
## Task

Migrate all React class components to functional components with hooks.

## Success Criteria

- All .jsx files under src/ use functional component syntax
- Tests pass (npm test)
- No console errors on dev server startup

## Constraints

- Preserve existing prop types
- Maintain component behavior (no logic changes)
- One component per commit

## Stop Conditions

- All tests passing
- No files matching class component pattern
- 30 consecutive failed iterations (reset to main)
```

**Key Principle**: The prompt defines _what_ (completion state), the loop discovers _how_ (implementation path).

### Git History as External Memory

Each iteration examines git history to understand progress:

```bash
git log --oneline -20        # Recent attempt history
git log --format="%s" -30    # Commit message patterns
git diff main                # Current state vs baseline
```

**Architecture Decision**: Store state in git commits, not context windows.

| Storage Location | Pros                                             | Cons                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Git history      | Survives context resets, append-only, structured | Token cost to read each iteration               |
| Context window   | No re-reading cost                               | Pollutes with failed attempts, cascading errors |

For mechanical tasks with 10+ iterations, git history provides better signal-to-noise ratio.

### Stop Conditions

Explicit completion signals prevent runaway loops:

**Positive completion**:

- All tests passing: `npm test && exit 0`
- No matching files: `! grep -r "class.*extends React.Component"`
- Metric threshold: `coverage > 80%`

**Safety exits**:

- Max iterations: 30 attempts without progress
- Time limit: 8-hour maximum runtime
- Cost ceiling: $50 budget exceeded

**Entropy management**:

- Reset to known-good state after 20 failed iterations
- Squash failed attempts every 10 commits

---

## Pattern Philosophy

### Iteration > Perfection

Traditional workflow: Plan → Execute → Validate → (if fail) Debug → Retry
Ralph workflow: Execute → Commit → Read history → Execute → Commit → ...

Failures don't block—they contribute to the solution space exploration. Each failed iteration narrows what doesn't work, guiding eventual success through elimination.

**Evidence**: Geoffrey Huntley's production data shows 85% completion rate for migration tasks with fresh-context iterations vs 60% with persistent context over 5+ hour sessions.

### The Smart Zone Insight

_[2026-01-21]_: Empirical testing shows only 40-60% of context window exhibits high-quality reasoning. Early tokens and late tokens show degraded performance. Tight task scoping keeps work within this smart zone. When tasks expand beyond it, iteration quality degrades.

**Strategy**: PROMPT.md should scope work to fit comfortably in smart zone. For large migrations, break into subtasks with separate prompts rather than one comprehensive specification.

### Self-Referential Feedback

The pattern creates closed-loop learning without human intervention:

```
Iteration N: Attempt migration of ComponentA
           ↓
Commit: "feat: migrate ComponentA (partial, test failures)"
           ↓
Iteration N+1: Reads git log, sees test failures, adjusts approach
           ↓
Commit: "fix: ComponentA test failures - missing useEffect deps"
           ↓
Iteration N+2: Reads success, moves to ComponentB
```

**Limitation**: Only works when git history provides sufficient signal. Tasks requiring external context (API docs, user feedback) still need human intervention.

---

## When to Use

### Best Fit

**Mechanical tasks with clear completion criteria:**

- Codebase-wide refactoring (rename variables, update imports)
- Dependency migrations (React 17→18, Python 3.9→3.11)
- Test coverage expansion (add tests until coverage > 80%)
- Style/linting fixes (apply ESLint rules across repository)
- Documentation generation (docstrings for all public APIs)

**Task characteristics:**

- Binary completion check (tests pass/fail, coverage met/not met)
- Multiple valid implementation paths (iteration explores options)
- Tolerance for failed attempts (each failure narrows solution space)
- Large volume of similar changes (amortizes setup cost)

**Evidence**: The pattern achieved $50,000 contract value for $297 in API costs, completed 14-hour React v16→v19 migration overnight, built CURSED programming language in 3 months for $14,000.

### Poor Fit

**Architectural decisions:**

- System design choices (database selection, framework architecture)
- API contract definition (breaking changes, versioning strategy)
- Security-sensitive code (authentication flows, encryption implementation)
- Ambiguous requirements (user experience, feature prioritization)

**Task characteristics:**

- Subjective completion criteria (requires human judgment)
- Single valid approach (iteration wastes resources)
- High cost of failure (security breach, data loss)
- Context-dependent decisions (requires accumulated understanding)

## Integration with Book Patterns

### vs. Plan-Build-Review

**Ralph Wiggum**:

- No explicit planning phase
- Iteration discovers the path
- Failures are expected and informative
- Git history serves as implicit "plan"

**Plan-Build-Review**:

- Structured phases with approval gates
- Specification precedes implementation
- Failures indicate process breakdown
- Explicit spec serves as contract

**When to use which**:

- Ralph: "Migrate 500 files to new API" (outcome clear, path flexible)
- PBR: "Design authentication system" (outcome requires judgment, path critical)

### vs. Self-Improving Experts

**Ralph Wiggum**:

- Improvement through iteration, no persistent learning
- Each session starts from zero (reads PROMPT.md + git log)
- Knowledge doesn't accumulate in prompts

**Self-Improving Experts**:

- Expertise.yaml accumulates learnings across sessions
- Improve-agent extracts patterns from git history
- Knowledge compounds (each session smarter than last)

**Synthesis Opportunity**: Combine Ralph's iteration loop with improve-agent:

1. Run Ralph loop for 4-hour session
2. Run improve-agent on git history
3. Update expertise.yaml with patterns discovered
4. Next Ralph session benefits from accumulated expertise

This creates **learning Ralph**: iteration loop that extracts meta-patterns and improves PROMPT.md automatically.

### vs. Orchestrator Pattern

**Ralph Wiggum**:

- Single-agent looping
- No explicit orchestration layer
- Parallelism through sequential iterations
- Simple bash loop coordination

**Orchestrator Pattern**:

- Multi-agent coordination with tool boundaries
- Orchestrator synthesizes outputs from specialists
- Parallel execution within single message
- Complex workflow primitives

**Production Insight**: Geoffrey Huntley's implementation uses 500 parallel Sonnet scouts for reads, 1 agent for builds. This is orchestration emerging within the loop—not explicit orchestrator, but similar separation of concerns.

**Synthesis**: Ralph + Orchestrator = **Iterative Orchestration**:

```
Loop:
  Parallel(scout_agents) → findings
  Plan(from findings) → spec
  Sequential(build_agents, dependency_aware) → implementation
  Commit + git log update
  Check completion criteria
  If incomplete: refine orchestration strategy for next iteration
```

### vs. Context-as-Code

**Tension**: Ralph deliberately discards context (fresh sessions) while Context-as-Code advocates for context accumulation. Both approaches are valid—depends on task type.

| Task Type                     | Best Approach         | Memory Strategy            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Mechanical, 10+ iterations    | Fresh context (Ralph) | Git history (external)     |
| Architectural, 1-3 iterations | Accumulated context   | Expertise files (internal) |

**Evidence**: Huntley's data shows migration tasks succeed 85% with fresh context vs 60% with persistent context (5+ hour sessions). Architectural tasks show inverse correlation—persistent context enables 70% success vs 40% fresh context.

---

## Best Practices

### Tight Task Scoping

Keep tasks within the smart zone (40-60% of context window). For large migrations, break into subtasks:

**Anti-pattern**: Single PROMPT.md covering 500-file migration
**Better**: Separate PROMPT.md per module (10-20 files each)

### Machine-Verifiable Success Criteria

Completion checks must be automatable:

```markdown
## Success Criteria

- All tests pass: `npm test`
- Coverage threshold: `coverage >= 80%`
- No linting errors: `npm run lint`
```

**Anti-pattern**: Subjective criteria like "code looks good" or "feels complete"

### Backpressure Control

Prevent runaway loops through explicit limits:

```markdown
## Safety Exits

- Max iterations: 30 attempts
- Time limit: 8 hours
- Cost ceiling: $50
- Reset trigger: 15 consecutive failures
```

### Entropy Management

Many low-quality commits create noise in git history. Mitigation strategies:

```markdown
## Git History Management

- Squash consecutive failures into single "attempted X" commit
- Preserve only successful completions in final history
- Reset to main branch if 15 consecutive failures
```

**Observed Issue**: After 50 iterations, git log can contain 30 failed attempts at the same approach, drowning signal in noise. Squashing failed attempts every 10 iterations maintains signal quality.

## Cost Optimization

### Model Selection Trade-offs

| Model    | Iterations to Completion | Cost per Iteration | Total Cost |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Sonnet   | 20 iterations            | ~$0.40             | ~$8        |
| Opus 4.5 | 5 iterations             | ~$1.20             | ~$6        |

**When to use Opus for Ralph**:

- High-value tasks (migration unblocks team)
- Tight deadlines (overnight completion vs multi-day)
- Complex reasoning per iteration (architectural refactoring)

**When to stick with Sonnet**:

- Low-priority tasks (can wait days for completion)
- Simple mechanical changes (renaming, formatting)
- Budget-constrained projects

**Community Data**: Average migration task costs $8 (Sonnet, 20 iterations) vs $6 (Opus, 5 iterations). Opus wins on speed and cost for complex tasks.

### Creator Profile

Geoffrey Huntley:

- Goat farmer in rural Australia
- Previous work: Open source developer tooling
- Philosophy: "Computers should work while humans sleep"
- Known for practical, production-focused automation patterns

### Community Reception

**Enthusiasts**:

- Matt Pocock (TypeScript educator): "Ralph Wiggum is the closest we've gotten to autonomous development that actually works in production."
- Dennison Bertram (AI researcher): "The loop structure is the breakthrough, not the model."

**Skeptics** raised concerns:

1. Task scoping failures (vague PROMPT.md → infinite loop)
2. Context pollution (fresh sessions discard valuable learnings)
3. Lack of verification gates (no safety checks before commits)
4. Cost unpredictability (can't estimate iterations required)

**Counterarguments**:

1. Scoping failures exist in human development too (unclear requirements)
2. Empirical data shows fresh context reduces cascading errors
3. Tests in success criteria serve as gates
4. Budget ceiling via max iterations (stop after N attempts)

### Anthropic Plugin vs Original Philosophy

**Anthropic Official Plugin**:

- Stop hooks (max iterations, time limits, cost ceilings)
- Plan regeneration after failures (adjusts PROMPT.md automatically)
- Progress reporting (estimated completion, current phase)
- Safety checks (test runs before commits)

**Original Philosophy (Huntley)**:

- Minimal structure: just the loop
- No automatic plan adjustment (PROMPT.md is immutable)
- No progress reporting (trust the process)
- Failures are valuable (don't prevent commits)

**Community Split**: Production teams use Anthropic plugin for safety. Researchers/hobbyists use original loop for experimentation.

## Open Questions

### Unanswered by Current Research

**Q1: What's the optimal iteration budget for different task types?**
Community data is anecdotal (5-20 iterations typical). No systematic study of task type → iteration count relationship.

**Q2: How does Ralph interact with test-driven development?**
TDD assumes tests before implementation. Ralph assumes iteration toward passing tests. Potential pattern: TDD for unit tests, Ralph for integration test coverage.

**Q3: Can Ralph learn across sessions without expertise files?**
Current pattern: each session starts fresh. Could git log analysis extract implicit expertise? "This approach failed 5 times across 3 sessions → avoid pattern X."

**Q4: What's the right level of PROMPT.md specificity?**
Too vague → infinite loop. Too specific → removes iteration benefit. No framework for calibrating this trade-off.

**Q5: How does model capability interact with iteration structure?**
Opus reduces iterations 4×. Does this mean iteration matters less for better models? Or does iteration amplify model capability?
