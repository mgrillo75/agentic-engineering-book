# Tool Design

Well-designed tools make the difference between an agent that can accomplish tasks and one that constantly struggles with its own interface.

---

## Tool Examples as Design Pattern

_[2025-12-09]_: JSON schemas define structural validity but can't teach usage—that's what examples are for.

**The Gap**: Schemas tell the model what parameters exist and their types, but not:

- When to include optional parameters
- Which parameter combinations make sense together
- API conventions not expressible in JSON Schema

**The Pattern**: Provide 1-5 concrete tool call examples demonstrating correct usage at varying complexity levels.

**Example Structure** (for a support ticket API):

1. **Minimal**: Title-only task—shows the floor
2. **Partial**: Feature request with some reporter info—shows selective use
3. **Full**: Critical bug with escalation, full metadata—shows the ceiling

This progression teaches when to use optional fields, not just that they exist.

**Results**: Internal testing showed accuracy improvement from 72% → 90% on complex parameter handling.

**Best Practices**:

- Use realistic data, not placeholder values ("John Doe", not "{name}")
- Focus examples on ambiguity areas not obvious from schema alone
- Show the minimal case first—don't always demonstrate full complexity
- Keep examples concise (1-5 per tool, not 20)

## Rich User Questioning Patterns

_[2026-01-30]_: Orchestration research from cc-mirror reveals sophisticated user clarification patterns that replace text-based menus with rich, decision-guiding question structures.

### Philosophy: Users Need to See Options

**Core insight:** "Users don't know what they want until they see the options"

Asking "What should I prioritize?" yields vague answers. Showing 4 options with descriptions, trade-offs, and recommendations enables informed decisions.

### The 4×4 Maximal Pattern

**Structure:**

- 4 questions addressing different decision dimensions
- 4 options per question with rich descriptions
- Trade-offs and implications explicit
- Recommended option guides optimal choice
- Multi-select support when appropriate

**Example: Feature Implementation Scope Clarification**

```python
AskUserQuestion(
    questions=[
        {
            "text": "What's the primary goal?",
            "options": [
                {
                    "label": "Performance optimization",
                    "description": "Focus on speed and efficiency. May increase code complexity and require more thorough testing.",
                    "recommended": True
                },
                {
                    "label": "Code simplicity",
                    "description": "Prioritize readability and maintainability over raw speed. Easier onboarding, longer execution time."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Feature completeness",

                    "label": "Graceful degradation",
                    "description": "Continue operation with reduced functionality. Better UX but errors may go unnoticed."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Retry with exponential backoff",
                    "description": "Automatic recovery from transient failures. Adds complexity and potential latency."
                },

                    "label": "Log and continue",
                    "description": "Silent failure recovery. Best for non-critical paths. Risk of hidden issues accumulating."
                }
            ]
        },

            "options": [
                {
                    "label": "Unit tests only",
                    "description": "Fast feedback, isolated verification. Misses integration issues. Good for pure logic."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Integration tests",
                    "description": "Verify component interactions. Slower but catches real-world failures. Recommended for APIs."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Full E2E suite",
                    "description": "Complete user flow validation. Highest confidence but longest execution. Expensive to maintain."
                },
                {

                    "description": "Skip automated tests initially. Fast development but manual verification burden. Technical debt."
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "text": "Deployment strategy?",
            "options": [
                {
                    "label": "Feature flag rollout",
                    "description": "Deploy to all, enable gradually. Instant rollback. Requires flag infrastructure."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Canary deployment",
                    "description": "Small user percentage first. Catch issues early. Needs monitoring and rollback automation."
                },
                {
                    "label": "Blue-green deployment",

                    "description": "Immediate production rollout. Fastest but highest risk. Acceptable for low-traffic features."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

### Anti-Pattern: Text-Based Menus

**Avoid:**

```
Please choose:
1. Fast
2. Cheap
3. Good quality

Which do you prefer?
```

**Problems:**

- No context about trade-offs
- Binary thinking (can't combine attributes)
- Vague options without implications
- No guidance toward optimal choice

### When to Use Maximal Questions

**Good fit:**

- Request admits multiple valid interpretations
- Choices meaningfully affect implementation approach
- Actions carry risk or are difficult to reverse
- User preferences influence trade-offs
- Scope clarification prevents rework

**Poor fit:**

- Decisions are obvious from context
- Only one reasonable approach exists
- User already provided detailed requirements
- Questions would annoy rather than clarify

### Implementation Guidelines

**Option descriptions should include:**

1. What this choice means concretely
2. Primary trade-off or cost
3. When this choice makes sense
4. What happens if this choice is wrong

**The recommended flag signals:**

- Optimal choice given typical constraints
- Not forcing—user can override
- Guides users unfamiliar with domain

**Multi-select enables:**

- "Performance AND simplicity" combinations
- "All of these except X" selections
- Prioritization without forced ranking

## Coding Agent Edit Formats

_[2026-04-11]_: Edit format selection is a first-order tool design decision for coding agents — one with direct consequences for model error rates, output size, and edit application reliability. The choice is model-capability-driven, not aesthetic.

### Three Primary Format Archetypes

| Format                    | Mechanism                                                     | Cognitive Load on Model                                                | Production Evidence                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Whole-file rewrite**    | Model returns complete updated file                           | Low — no line number tracking required                                 | Reliable; expensive for large files                |
| **Unified diff (udiff)**  | Standard diff format with `+`/`-` line prefixes               | High — requires tracking original line numbers before writing new code | Used for legacy models with "lazy coding" tendency |
| **Search-replace blocks** | Model specifies exact text to find and exact replacement text | Medium — no line numbers; exact string matching                        | Most models in production; Aider's primary format  |

The cognitive load distinction is significant. Unified diff requires the model to know the line count of original content _before_ writing new code — a constraint that causes errors on complex edits. Search-replace blocks avoid this by using content identity rather than position. Whole-file rewrites sidestep both constraints at the cost of output token volume.

### Model-Capability-Driven Format Selection

Aider's production documentation provides the most concrete evidence available for model-specific format selection:

| Model Family                                     | Recommended Format                | Reason                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most modern models (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5+) | Search-replace (`diff`)           | Reliable exact-match application; balanced output size                       |
| Gemini models (older)                            | `diff-fenced` (path inside fence) | Standard fencing syntax failed consistently                                  |
| GPT-4 Turbo                                      | `udiff`                           | Mitigated "lazy coding" — replacing implementation with placeholder comments |
| Architect mode tasks                             | `editor-diff` / `editor-whole`    | Streamlined for multi-file operations in a separate editor model             |

**The practical implication:** format choice is not a configuration detail — it is a tool design decision that affects model reliability at the task level. When a model produces incorrect edits, audit the edit format before adjusting the prompt.

### Poka-Yoke Constraints for Coding Tools

Anthropic's SWE-bench implementation provides a concrete example of constraint-based tool design: converting relative to absolute filepaths as a required tool input. The result was measurable reduction in model path errors — the tool became harder to use incorrectly.

**The principle:** coding agent tools benefit from constraints that prevent common model errors:

- Require absolute paths (eliminates relative-path resolution errors)
- Require exact string matching in search-replace (prevents approximate matches that corrupt context)
- Validate that referenced line numbers exist before executing edits (prevents off-by-one failures)

These are not validation afterthoughts — they are design decisions that change model behavior by making the wrong action structurally difficult.

## Coding Agent Tool Inventory

_[2026-04-11]_: Coding agents use a recurring, minimal tool set. Raschka identifies the baseline as five named tools; Anthropic's SWE-bench work extends this with patch-application tools. Understanding the canonical inventory prevents over-engineering the tool layer.

### Standard Inventory

| Tool                        | Role                                               | Notes                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read_file`                 | Retrieve file content for context                  | Prefer whole-file for small files; line-range for large |
| `write_file` / `apply_edit` | Persist changes to disk                            | Format depends on edit format choice (see above)        |
| `search` / `grep`           | Find symbols, patterns, references across the repo | Critical for navigation without full-file reads         |
| `bash` / `shell`            | Run commands, tests, linters, build tools          | Primary execution feedback mechanism                    |
| `list_files` / `ls`         | Directory traversal and discovery                  | Supports repo orientation without reading every file    |

Claude Code adds a sixth functional layer via hooks — pre/post action enforcement that operates outside the agent's direct tool calls. This is best understood as a meta-tool: it applies constraints and side effects that the agent cannot disable.

**Minimum viable set for most coding tasks:** `read_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, `search`. The other tools improve efficiency but are not required for correctness on small codebases.
