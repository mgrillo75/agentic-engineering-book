# Context as Code

**Treat agent knowledge like software, not documents.**

This extends the "Specs as Source Code" mental model beyond specifications to all context artifacts: knowledge bases, expertise files, tool descriptions, and system prompts. If it shapes agent behavior, it's source code.

---

## Your Mental Model

**Knowledge artifacts are source code.** Version control them, test them, refactor them, and document them with the same rigor you apply to Python or JavaScript. When you edit an agent's context without tracking what changed and why, you're cowboy-coding in production.

Knowledge bases aren't documentation—they're the runtime instructions that determine agent behavior. Treating them as "just text files" is like treating your application code as "just text files" and editing it in Notepad without version control.

---

## What This Looks Like in Practice

The ACE playbook format exemplifies context as code:

```text
[str-00001] helpful=5 harmful=0 :: Use structured output for complex tasks
[cal-00003] helpful=8 harmful=0 :: Token cost = (input + output) * rate
[mis-00004] helpful=6 harmful=0 :: Don't retry on rate limits without backoff
[con-00002] helpful=7 harmful=0 :: Context window = working memory
[too-00001] helpful=9 harmful=0 :: Grep before Edit to avoid blind writes
```

Each line is:

- **Uniquely identified** (`[prefix-ID]`) - enables precise references, easy refactoring
- **Performance tested** (`helpful=X harmful=Y`) - like unit tests for knowledge
- **Category-organized** (`str-`, `cal-`, `mis-`, `con-`, `too-`) - modular design
- **Self-describing** (the content itself explains what it does)

---

## Software Engineering Patterns Applied to Context

### Version Control: Track Changes, Enable Rollback

```bash
# Traditional documentation
docs/agent-knowledge.md  # edited directly, no history

# Context as code
git log --oneline knowledge/strategies.md
a3f2b1c Add retry strategy for transient failures
e4d5c6f Remove deprecated authentication approach
f7g8h9i Refactor error handling strategies

git diff e4d5c6f..a3f2b1c knowledge/strategies.md
- [str-00015] helpful=2 harmful=3 :: Use basic auth for API calls
+ [str-00015] helpful=8 harmful=0 :: Use OAuth2 with refresh tokens
```

When agent behavior regresses, you can `git bisect` to find which knowledge change caused it.

### Testing: Helpful/Harmful Counters as Unit Tests

```text
# Before testing
[str-00023] :: Always validate user input

# After testing (knowledge has test results)
[str-00023] helpful=12 harmful=0 :: Always validate user input
```

The counters are like test pass/fail metrics:

- `helpful > 0, harmful = 0` → Proven valuable, keep it
- `helpful = 0, harmful > 0` → Causes problems, remove or refactor
- `helpful > 0, harmful > 0` → Context-dependent, needs conditions

You can track these over time like code coverage metrics.

### Modular Organization: Category Prefixes, Unique IDs

```text
strategies/
  str-00001.md  # High-level approaches
  str-00002.md
calculations/
  cal-00001.md  # Formulas and computations
  cal-00003.md
mistakes/
  mis-00001.md  # Anti-patterns to avoid
  mis-00004.md
concepts/
  con-00001.md  # Domain knowledge
  con-00002.md
tools/
  too-00001.md  # Tool usage patterns
  too-00005.md
```

Just like code modules, categories enable:

- **Focused loading**: Only load relevant categories for specific tasks
- **Dependency tracking**: `[str-00012]` references `[con-00003]` and `[too-00007]`
- **Easier refactoring**: Move entries between categories without breaking references

### Refactoring: Semantic Deduplication

```text
# Before refactoring (duplication)
[str-00008] :: For database queries, use connection pooling
[str-00015] :: When connecting to databases, use a connection pool
[too-00023] :: Database access should use connection pooling

# After refactoring (DRY principle)
[str-00008] helpful=15 harmful=0 :: Use connection pooling for database access
# References: too-00023, db-architecture.md
```

Like code refactoring, you extract common patterns, eliminate redundancy, and maintain a single source of truth.

### Documentation: Each Entry is Self-Describing

```text
# Weak (requires external context)
[str-00042] :: Use the pattern

# Strong (self-contained)
[str-00042] helpful=6 harmful=0 :: For multi-step workflows, use plan-build-review pattern to separate planning from execution
```

Like good function names and docstrings, each knowledge entry should be understandable in isolation.

---

## When to Apply This Model

### Good Fit

**Production agent systems**: When agents run in production, their knowledge determines user-facing behavior. Treat it with production code rigor.

**Multi-agent systems**: When knowledge is shared across multiple agents, version control and testing prevent one agent's changes from breaking another.

**Evolving domains**: When knowledge needs frequent updates (new APIs, changing policies), treating context as code makes evolution traceable and reversible.

**Team collaboration**: When multiple people contribute to agent knowledge, version control and structure prevent conflicts and enable review.

### Poor Fit

**Prototype exploration**: When you're still figuring out what knowledge the agent needs, heavyweight structure slows discovery. Start informal, formalize later.

**Static, finished systems**: If the knowledge is complete and won't change, the overhead of treating it as source code isn't justified.

**Single-person, short-lived projects**: For quick experiments, simple text files work fine. Add structure when the project grows.

---

## The Continuum: From Documents to Code

```text
Documents                                                    Code
    │                                                         │
    ├─ Plain text notes (no structure)                       │
    ├─ Markdown with sections (light structure)              │
    ├─ Structured markdown with metadata (ACE playbook)      │
    ├─ Machine-parseable format with schema (JSON/YAML)      │
    └─ Formal specifications with validation (contracts) ────┘
```

You don't need to jump straight to the "code" end. The ACE playbook hits a sweet spot: human-readable markdown with just enough structure (IDs, counters, categories) to enable software engineering practices.

## Agent-as-Code: Version-Controlled Agent Definitions

_[2026-02-06]_: The "context as code" mental model extends to agent definitions themselves. BMAD-METHOD demonstrates treating agents as first-class version-controlled code artifacts—portable, reusable, and shareable like any code file.

### The Pattern

Instead of runtime configurations or opaque API settings, agents are **self-contained markdown files with embedded YAML**:

```markdown
<!-- agent-definition.md -->

# Security Expert Agent

Specialized agent for security architecture, threat modeling, and vulnerability analysis.

## Role

You are a security architect with expertise in authentication, authorization,
and secure system design.

## Capabilities

- OAuth2/OIDC protocol implementation
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Security audit and code review
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA)

## Workflows

- security-audit: Comprehensive security review
- threat-model: Analyze attack surfaces
- auth-design: Design authentication flows

---

# Agent Configuration (YAML)

name: security-expert
type: specialist
model: claude-sonnet-4.5
temperature: 0.3
tools: [Read, Grep, Execute]
```

### Why This Matters

**Institutional knowledge preservation:**
A security expert's knowledge—how to think about threat models, what to check in audits, which patterns prevent vulnerabilities—becomes **portable code**. When team members change, the expertise remains.

**Cross-project reusability:**

```bash
# Copy agent definition to new project
cp ~/agents/security-expert.md ./project-x/.agents/

# Agent immediately available with full expertise
```

**Transparent system composition:**

```text
agents/
├── security-expert.md         # 245 lines
├── architect.md               # 312 lines
├── developer.md               # 289 lines
└── qa-engineer.md             # 198 lines

Total expertise: 1,044 lines of version-controlled knowledge
```

### Manifest-Driven Transparency

BMAD tracks agents, workflows, and tasks via CSV manifests:

```csv
# agents.csv
AgentId,Name,Description,FilePath,WorkflowTriggers
bmm-001,Security Expert,Security architecture and threat modeling,agents/security-expert.md,security-audit|threat-model
bmm-002,Architect,System design and technical decisions,agents/architect.md,create-architecture|tech-review
```

This provides:

- **Complete inventory**: What agents exist?
- **Capability mapping**: What can each agent do?
- **Dependency tracking**: Which workflows require which agents?
- **Easier debugging**: Manifest shows system composition at a glance

### Version Control Benefits

Agents under version control enable:

```bash
# Track agent evolution
git log agents/security-expert.md
a3f2b1c Added OWASP Top 10 checks to security audit workflow
e4d5c6f Updated OAuth2 PKCE flow recommendations
f7g8h9i Improved threat modeling methodology

# Compare agent versions
git diff v1.0..v2.0 agents/security-expert.md

# Rollback problematic changes
git revert f7g8h9i
```

When agent behavior regresses, version control enables diagnosis: "What changed in the agent definition that caused this?"

### Production Example: BMAD-METHOD

BMAD-METHOD (34.5k GitHub stars) implements agent-as-code across 26 agents:

**Core orchestrator:**

- BMad Master: Coordinates all 26 agents

**Business Method Module (9 agents):**

- Mary (Analyst), John (PM), Winston (Architect), Amelia (Developer)
- Quinn (QA), Bob (Scrum Master), Barry (Quick Flow Dev)
- Sally (UX), Paige (Technical Writer)

**Builder Module (3 agents):**

- Agents for creating custom agents, modules, workflows

**Each agent:**

- Self-contained markdown file
- Embedded YAML configuration
- Fuzzy-match triggers for activation
- Portable across projects

### Framework Extension: BMB Module

BMAD includes agents specifically for _creating_ agents:

```text
/create-agent "API integration specialist"
    ↓
Builder agent generates:
- agent-definition.md (role, capabilities, instructions)
- agent-config.yaml (model, tools, workflows)
- workflow templates for common tasks
```

**Meta-pattern:** Agents as code enables agents that _generate_ agents. The builder module creates new agent definitions following the same markdown + YAML pattern.

### Comparison to Runtime Configurations

| Runtime Config                | Agent-as-Code                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| JSON/YAML blob in API call    | Markdown file with embedded config  |
| Exists only during execution  | Persists as version-controlled file |
| Opaque system composition     | Transparent (read the files)        |
| Hard to share across projects | Copy file, instant reuse            |
| Manual documentation required | Self-documenting                    |
| No change history             | Full git history                    |

### When to Use Agent-as-Code

**Good fit:**

- Building reusable agent libraries for organization
- Multi-project environments where agents should be consistent
- Teams needing audit trail of agent behavior changes
- Complex agent systems requiring transparency

**Not necessary for:**

- One-off agent uses
- Simple single-agent systems
- Exploratory prototyping (formalize later)
- Projects with stable, unchanging agent requirements

### Integration with Other Patterns

**Self-Improving Experts pattern:**
Agent-as-code enables the improve phase to update agent definitions directly. Learnings from production update the markdown file, improving future runs.

**Orchestrator pattern:**
Manifest-driven transparency shows which agents the orchestrator can coordinate, their capabilities, and dependencies.

**Knowledge Evolution:**
Agent definitions are knowledge artifacts that evolve over time, following same version control practices as other context.

### Implementation Checklist

If implementing agent-as-code:

- [ ] Define agent structure (markdown format, YAML schema)
- [ ] Create agent manifest (CSV or JSON tracking system)
- [ ] Version control agent definitions
- [ ] Document agent creation guidelines
- [ ] Build tooling for agent discovery (loading from manifest)
- [ ] Test agent portability (copy to new project, verify function)
- [ ] Add agent update workflow (how to improve agents)

### Open Questions

- What's the right balance between reusable generic agents vs specialized project-specific agents?
- How to handle agent definition conflicts when merging across projects?
- Can agent-as-code support dynamic agent generation at runtime, or only static definitions?
- What testing framework validates agent definitions without executing them?

## Implications

### Knowledge Reviews Like Code Reviews

```markdown
# PR: Update authentication strategies

Changes to knowledge/strategies/:

- [str-00042] helpful=2 harmful=5 :: Use basic auth

* [str-00042] helpful=8 harmful=0 :: Use OAuth2 with PKCE flow
* [str-00058] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: For mobile apps, use refresh token rotation

Reviewer: "str-00042 improvement looks good. For str-00058, have we tested
harmful=0? Refresh token rotation can cause issues if not handled correctly."
```

### Knowledge Regression Testing

```python
def test_agent_follows_knowledge():
    """Verify agent applies knowledge correctly."""
    agent = load_agent_with_knowledge("knowledge/strategies.md")

    # Test that str-00042 is applied
    response = agent.handle_auth_request(mock_request)
    assert response.auth_method == "OAuth2"
    assert response.uses_pkce == True

    # Increment helpful counter if successful
    increment_helpful("str-00042")
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Engineering Early

**Problem**: Creating elaborate versioning and testing infrastructure before you know what knowledge the agent needs.

**Solution**: Start with simple markdown. Add structure (IDs, categories, counters) when you have enough entries that organization becomes painful. Add testing when you have enough history to know what "helpful" looks like.

### Treating All Context Equally

**Problem**: Applying heavy structure to ephemeral context that doesn't need it (one-off prompts, temporary instructions).

**Solution**: Distinguish between:

- **Core knowledge** (long-lived, reused, tested) → Treat as code
- **Task-specific context** (one-off, temporary) → Keep lightweight
- **Generated content** (can be regenerated) → Don't version control

### Losing the Human-Readable Aspect

**Problem**: Making context so structured and formal that humans can't easily read and edit it.

**Solution**: The ACE playbook maintains readability. Avoid formats that require parsing tools to understand. Markdown with light structure is the sweet spot.
