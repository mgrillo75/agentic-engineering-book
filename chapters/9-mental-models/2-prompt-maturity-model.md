# Prompt Maturity Model

A framework for understanding and designing prompts at different levels of sophistication. Each level builds on the previous, adding new capabilities and complexity.

## The Seven Levels

### Level 1: Static

**What defines it**: Hardcoded instructions with no variation. The prompt is the same every time it runs.

**When to use it**: For simple, repeatable tasks that never need customization. Quick utilities where the overhead of parameters isn't worth it.

**Example**: A command that always formats code the same way, or always runs the same test suite.

```markdown
# format-code.md

Run prettier on all TypeScript files in src/
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: Simplest to write and understand. No state to manage.
- Cons: Inflexible. Requires creating new commands for variations.

---

### Level 2: Parameterized

**What defines it**: Uses `$ARGUMENTS` or other variables to accept input at runtime.

**When to use it**: When you need the same logic with different inputs. The behavior is consistent but the data varies.

**Example**: From the knowledge base examples, commands that take a file path or topic as input.

```markdown
# review-file.md

Review the file at $ARGUMENTS for clarity and completeness.
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: Reusable across different inputs. Still straightforward logic.
- Cons: Limited to simple substitution. No branching behavior.

---

### Level 3: Conditional

**What defines it**: Contains if/else logic or branching based on input characteristics.

**When to use it**: When the same command needs to behave differently depending on what it receives.

**Example**: A command that processes markdown differently than code files, or handles different file types.

```markdown
# analyze.md

If $ARGUMENTS contains .ts or .js:

- Check for type safety issues
  Else if $ARGUMENTS contains .md:
- Check for broken links
  Else:
- Provide general analysis
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: One command handles multiple scenarios. More intelligent.
- Cons: Logic can become complex. Harder to predict behavior.

---

### Level 4: Contextual

**What defines it**: Reads external files or project state before acting. Uses context to inform decisions.

**When to use it**: When the prompt needs to understand the broader environment. Common with project-aware commands.

**Example**: The `/tools:prime` command that gathers project context, or commands that read CLAUDE.md before working.

```markdown
# contextualized-review.md

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand project conventions
2. Read the file at $ARGUMENTS
3. Review against project standards
4. Suggest improvements that fit the codebase
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: Decisions informed by actual project state. More intelligent.
- Cons: Slower due to file reads. Can fail if context is missing.

---

### Level 5: Higher Order

**What defines it**: Invokes other commands as subroutines. Orchestrates multiple operations.

**When to use it**: For workflows that combine several distinct steps, or meta-commands that coordinate other commands.

**Example**: This book's `/do` command orchestration (`.claude/commands/do.md`) demonstrates higher-order coordination by classifying user requirements and routing to appropriate expert domains. Workflow commands that call research, implement, and review commands in sequence also fit this level.

```markdown
# feature-workflow.md

1. Call /research:gather-requirements $ARGUMENTS
2. Call /plan:design-architecture
3. Call /implement:build
4. Call /review:validate
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: Compose complex behaviors from simpler parts. DRY.
- Cons: Dependencies between commands. Harder to debug failures.

---

### Level 6: Self-Modifying

**What defines it**: Updates its own template based on outcomes or feedback.

**When to use it**: When a command should learn from its usage patterns and improve itself over time.

**Example**: The `*_improve.md` pattern seen in some agentic systems where commands track their failures and update their instructions.

```markdown
# adaptive-analyzer.md

[CURRENT TEMPLATE]
Analyze code for: ${FOCUS_AREAS}

[IMPROVEMENT MECHANISM]
After each run:

- If analysis missed issues: add to FOCUS_AREAS
- If too verbose: add to SUPPRESS_PATTERNS
- Update this template
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: Commands get better with use. Adapt to project needs.
- Cons: Non-deterministic. Can drift from original intent. Needs safeguards.

---

### Level 7: Meta-Cognitive

**What defines it**: Improves other commands, not just itself. Operates on the command system as a whole.

**When to use it**: For maintenance and evolution of the command ecosystem. Quality assurance for prompts.

**Example**: A bulk-update orchestrator that analyzes all commands and suggests improvements, or a command that identifies redundant commands and proposes consolidation.

```markdown
# command-optimizer.md

1. Scan all .md commands in .claude/
2. Identify patterns:
   - Duplicated logic
   - Commands that could be parameterized
   - Missing error handling
3. Generate improvement proposals
4. Execute approved updates
```

**Trade-offs**:

- Pros: System-wide optimization. Maintains command quality.
- Cons: Highest complexity. Requires understanding of entire system. Risk of breaking changes.

---

## Choosing the Right Level

**Start at the lowest level that solves the problem.**

- **Level 1-2**: Most commands should live here. Simple is better.
- **Level 3**: Use sparingly. Often a sign you need multiple commands instead.
- **Level 4**: Standard for project-aware tools. Worth the context-gathering cost.
- **Level 5**: Good for defined workflows. Keep orchestration logic simple.
- **Level 6**: Experimental. Needs monitoring and rollback capability.
- **Level 7**: Rare. Usually for tooling teams or advanced automation.

**Signals you need a higher level:**

- Creating many similar commands → Move from 1 to 2
- Copy-pasting logic between commands → Move to 5
- Manually tweaking commands after each use → Consider 6
- Spending more time maintaining commands than using them → Consider 7

**Signals you're at too high a level:**

- Can't predict what the command will do
- Debugging takes longer than the command saves
- Other developers avoid using it
- You're the only one who understands it

**The maturity sweet spot**: Most systems should have a pyramid distribution:

- Many Level 1-2 commands (foundation)
- Some Level 3-4 commands (core workflows)
- Few Level 5 commands (orchestration)
- Rare Level 6-7 commands (if any)

## Engineer Leverage Progression

_[2026-04-11]_: The seven levels above describe prompt artifact sophistication. A complementary dimension describes practitioner workflow sophistication — how an individual engineer's _framing_ of AI use changes as leverage increases. This axis is orthogonal: an engineer can write a structurally sophisticated L4-L5 prompt while still operating in a low-leverage framing. Liu's central observation names the gap precisely: "One engineer treats AI like a better search engine. The other treats AI like an entire engineering team working in concert."

Three stages characterize the progression, observed independently by multiple practitioners:

### Stage 1 — Search-Engine Framing

**Framing:** AI as a better search interface or text transformer.

**Behavior:** Isolated, one-off queries. Context is provided per-query without codebase integration. Output is treated as reference material, not an executable artifact. Each query begins fresh with no compounding context.

**Prompt-level correlation:** Typically L1-L3. Parameterization adds flexibility, but the workflow remains point-to-point. A well-structured L4 prompt can appear in Stage 1 framing when the engineer pastes context manually without workflow integration.

**Named by:** Liu [1] — the "David" example: a meeting transcript pasted into a fresh session produces a plan disconnected from actual system architecture regardless of prompt quality.

**Key limitation:** No feedback loop. Each query begins fresh; there are no compounding returns.

### Stage 2 — Integrated Workflow Framing

**Framing:** AI as a pipeline stage whose output feeds subsequent stages.

**Behavior:** Complete context is provided — full meeting transcript plus codebase, not fragments. Output is designed for downstream consumption: PRD feeds tickets, tickets feed Plan.md, Plan.md feeds agentic execution. Humans design the workflow; AI executes stages within it.

**Prompt-level correlation:** Typically L4-L5. Contextual and higher-order prompts are structurally required by this framing — the workflow's pipeline structure forces L4+ because each stage must be informed by the previous stage's output.

**Named by:** Liu [1] — the "Elena" example: complete workflow from meeting to executable plan; Willison [7] — "lead on design, delegate on implementation."

**Key advancement:** Compounding context. Each stage's output enriches the next stage's input; returns accumulate across the pipeline.

### Stage 3 — System Designer Framing

**Framing:** AI as a component in a designed system with feedback loops, measurement, and self-improvement.

**Behavior:** Engineers define evaluation criteria before implementation. Error analysis precedes optimization. Measurement infrastructure — evals, tracing, human review — is designed first; automation of benchmarks follows manual understanding, not the reverse.

**Prompt-level correlation:** Typically L5-L7. Meta-cognitive prompts (Level 7) emerge from the demands of this framing: once an engineer treats the system as measurable, prompts that improve themselves become structurally necessary rather than optional.

**Named by:** Hamel [4] [6] — manual error analysis is the highest-ROI starting point; "good writing is good thinking" — prompt engineering requires active intellectual engagement; Willison [7] — design decisions remain human before delegation to the system.

**Key advancement:** Feedback discipline. Improvement is systematic rather than intuitive; the measurement infrastructure determines what is worth optimizing.

| Stage               | Framing                       | Typical Prompt Level | Compounding Returns                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Search-Engine       | Query-response                | L1-L3                | None — each query begins fresh                    |
| Integrated Workflow | Pipeline stage                | L4-L5                | Moderate — context accumulates across stages      |
| System Designer     | Designed system with feedback | L5-L7                | High — measurement enables systematic improvement |

The stages correlate with but do not determine prompt level. An engineer can reach Stage 2 while using only L3-L4 prompts — the workflow framing will pull prompt sophistication upward as the engineer encounters the structural requirements of pipeline stages. Hamel's principle applies to the transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3: manual engagement precedes effective automation. Stage 3 cannot be reached by automating Stage 1 behaviors; the judgment about what to measure must be developed manually before measurement can compound.

Stage 2 integration maps directly to leverage points [#1 (ADWs) and #3 (Plans)](../1-foundations/1-twelve-leverage-points.md) in the Twelve Leverage Points hierarchy — the pipeline structure of Stage 2 is what makes Plans (#3) genuinely executable and ADWs (#1) designable rather than improvised. Stage 3 maps to #5 (Tests) and the measurement infrastructure that distinguishes production-grade from experimental systems. Stage 3 also corresponds to the individual prerequisite for operating at Shapiro Level 3-4 in the [Software Factories](../9-mental-models/7-software-factories.md) framework.

- **To [Prompt Structuring](../2-prompt/2-structuring.md):** Structural choices (output templates, failure sentinels, state machines) enable prompts to move up maturity levels—the techniques that make higher levels possible
- **To [Self-Improving Experts](../7-patterns/2-self-improving-experts.md):** Self-modifying (Level 6) and meta-cognitive (Level 7) prompts parallel expert system evolution. The three-command expert pattern (Plan-Build-Improve) implements Level 6 maturity.
- **To [Knowledge Evolution](../8-practices/6-knowledge-evolution.md):** Tracking prompt maturity progression mirrors knowledge base maturity—both evolve from simple to sophisticated through observation and refinement
- **To [Twelve Leverage Points](../1-foundations/1-twelve-leverage-points.md):** The Engineer Leverage Progression stages map onto the leverage hierarchy: Stage 2 framing enables Plans (#3) and ADWs (#1); Stage 3 framing enables Tests (#5) and system-level measurement. The Anti-Patterns by Leverage Level section in that entry identifies the specific failure modes that Stage 1 framing produces when applied to high-leverage points.
- **To [Evaluation](../8-practices/2-evaluation.md):** Prompt maturity and evaluation maturity co-evolve. Reaching Level 5+ prompt sophistication (higher-order, self-modifying) without corresponding evaluation infrastructure produces unmeasured complexity—changes to self-modifying prompts can degrade behavior in ways that only systematic evaluation detects. The Evaluation Maturity Curve in that section maps directly: Level 1–2 prompts (static, parameterized) pair with manual evaluation; Level 5+ prompts (higher-order, self-modifying) require at minimum scripted automated evaluation to remain maintainable.
